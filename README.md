### Reflection
This assignment was kind of tough. We had to do 2 types of the swing arm. The sketch was kind of hard for me too. There were a lot of fillets that we had to add and also figuring out the mass of the swing arm. Overall, tough but I learned something new.

### Reflection
This assignment was the hardest cad assignment I've done, because we could only work in one studio. This also made it hard to mate connect each part, as well as copy and transform each part. We also had to change the variables to create a new version of the parts.
