### Reflection
This assignment was kind of tough. We had to do 2 types of the swing arm. The sketch was kind of hard for me too. There were a lot of fillets that we had to add and also figuring out the mass of the swing arm. Overall, tough but I learned something new.

### Reflection
For this part of the assignment, we had to actually assemble the parts together. This part of the assignment was easy because it was when both partners work together to get it built. I got part B into the assembly and my partner got part A in.

### Reflection
Overall, this assignment was definitely the hardest assignment I've done. Just the fact that your following the drawings given were kind of hard to follow. They look confusing in some cases. There was math involved and some things you had to do that was kind of hard. The finished product looks cool and I'm glad I did this because now I can actually make parts using drawings better.
