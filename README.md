## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
This assignment was our intro assignment to circuitpython. Our job was to get the neopixel to blink and change colors. 



```python
import board
import neopixel
import time 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 
while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((255, 255, 255))
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

### Wiring
There wasn't any wiring required in this assignment.

### Reflection
This assignment took longer than needed, because of the initial importing of functions into cirucuit python. I also had trouble using the serial monitor as well.




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

```python
import time
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo


pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D7, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)


my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5):
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)

```

### Reflection
This assignment's wiring was pretty easy, because there was no extra wires needed. I got help with my code from [Grant G](https://github.com/ggastin30/CPython#description--code-1)


## CircuitPython_DistanceSensor 

### Description & Code

```python
import board
import adafruit_hcsr04
import neopixel
import time
import simpleio

sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D7, echo_pin=board.D6)
klee = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
klee.brightness = .3  
red=0
blue=0
green=0
while True:
    try:
        cm = sonar.distance
        print((sonar.distance))
        time.sleep(0.01)
        if cm < 5:
            klee.fill((255, 0, 0))
        if cm > 5 and cm <20:
         red=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,20,255,0)
         green=0
         blue=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,20,0,255)
         klee.fill((red,green,blue))
      
       
        if cm > 20 and cm < 35:
         red=0
         green=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,20,0,255)
         blue=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,20,0,255)
         klee.fill((green,blue,red))
    except RuntimeError:
        print("Retrying!")
        pass

    time.sleep(0.1)

```

### Reflection
This assignment was good, because it relied more on the code than the wiring. The hardest part was finding the values to put in for the colors, and when the colors would change. I also learned that it's really hard to input each value into a code, than make a code that runs through all the values instead. 



## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code

```python
import board
import math
import time
from lcd.lcd import LCD                                     
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface   
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
i2c = board.I2C()
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)
btn = DigitalInOut(board.D3)
btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D2)
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.UP
btn2.pull = Pull.UP
num = 0                     
Redo = True                   

lcd.print("Starting")
while True:                                 
    if btn.value == True and Redo == True:   
        if btn2.value == True:                     
            num = num - 1
        else:
            num = num + 1                                   
        lcd.clear()
        lcd.print(str(num))
        Redo = False
        time.sleep(.1)
    elif btn.value == False and Redo == False:
        Redo = True

### Reflection
This assignment was challenging for me, because of the time it took to map the sensor. It also took a while to make the led work with the buttons. This assignment was good, because it taught me how to count down with another button, which I have never done before. The last part I struggled with, was finding the right amount of time between each button push. If the time was too short, then the numbers would go up twice when I pressed once. But if the time was too long, then the next time I pressed the button, the button wouldn't be registered.
